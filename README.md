This repository hosts the foundational papers, simulation code, and results for the **Unified Holographic Resonance Theory (UHRT)**, a theoretical framework that fuses arithmetic proportionality with entropic dynamics to model reality as a holographic system. UHRT integrates concepts from quantum mechanics, holography, and information theory, proposing a computable model for dimensional evolution and complexity emergence.

The theory is built on three key papers:
- **Paper 1**: Introduces the Composite Dimensional Evolution Framework (MEDC), focusing on arithmetic proportionality as the generative engine.
- **Paper 2**: Presents the Layered Conceptual Framework (LCF), describing entropic progression from quantum duality to meta-reflection, unified by the Universal Binary Scale (UBS).
- **Paper 3**: Fuses MEDC and LCF into UHRT, with unified axioms, a "Super Metric," and computational simulations.

## Overview
UHRT posits that reality emerges from a holographic resonance driven by:
- **Arithmetic Proportionality** (from MEDC): Stabilizes dimensional structures via rules like the Simple and Compound Rules of Three.
- **Entropic Dynamics** (from LCF): Drives complexity through nine layers, bounded by entropy and holographic principles.
- **Fusion Elements**: A primordial "Glitch" for symmetry breaking, a pyramidal topology, and a Super Metric combining UBS with inverse proportionality.

The repository includes LaTeX sources and PDFs for the papers, Python simulation scripts (e.g., for graph-based modeling and glitch scenarios), and generated results (e.g., graphs and outputs). Simulations validate the theory by demonstrating how arithmetic glitches trigger entropic pruning in a knowledge graph.

This project extends prior work in neurosymbolic reasoning and semantic modeling (see [Related Projects](#related-projects)).

### Paper 1: Composite Dimensional Evolution Framework: A Foundational Theory based on Arithmetic Proportionality
**Abstract:**  
This document presents a theoretical framework that postulates a fundamental isomorphism between geometric dimensional progression and the evolution of arithmetic proportionality. We propose that the **Simple Rule of Three** is not merely a calculation tool, but the "Theory of Everything" (ToE) of a flat (2D) universe. We argue that higher dimensions emerge through a process of "composite duplication" that is algebraically reflected in the **Compound Rule of Three**.  

We introduce the concept of the **"Glitch"** as a quantum catalyst (analogous to the collapse of a qubit) that forces the dimensional leap. Finally, we model this progression as a **pyramidal structure** with a "Double Composite Echo," where the "reality density" at each level is measured using **inverse proportional relationships**.

**Key Methods/Approach:**  
- **Dimensional Progression Modeling**: Starts from 0D (point) to nD (hyperspace) using geometric extrusion and arithmetic rules (e.g., Simple Ratio for 1D, Simple Rule of Three for 2D, Compound Rule for 3D+).  
- **Glitch as Catalyst**: Defined as symmetry breaking, with quantum analogies (qubit collapse, entanglement).  
- **Pyramidal Topology**: Uses inverse proportionality for density measurement ($\rho_n \propto 1/L^n$).  
- **Mathematical Formalisms**: Equations for rules of three, density, and holographic projections. References include Kandinsky (1926), 't Hooft (1993), and Susskind (1995).

### Paper 2: A Layered Conceptual Framework: From Quantum Duality to Meta-Reflection in a Holographic Universe, Unified by the Universal Binary Scale (UBS)
**Abstract:**  
This paper introduces a novel layered conceptual framework that describes the evolution of reality from fundamental quantum dualities to a meta-reflective, holographic universe. Comprising nine progressive layers, the framework integrates geometric emergence, dynamic interactions, information entropy, and recursive cycles to explain the multiplication of conceptual units and the unification of measurable phenomena. Complementing this, the Universal Binary Scale (UBS) serves as a unifying metric, quantifying all elements in bits of information entropy, drawing from Shannon's theory, Wheeler's "It from Bit," and holographic principles. The framework posits that opposites and complexity arise through iterative duplication, limited by entropy bounds, providing an intuitive model for cosmic evolution. We formalize this with axioms, derive implications for interdisciplinary applications, and demonstrate algorithmic implementations for simulation and optimization.

**Key Methods/Approach:**  
- **Nine-Layer Progression**: From Layer 1 (Duality) to Layer 9 (Cycles), using iterative multiplication, geometric emergence (e.g., points to tetrahedrons), and entropic bounds.  
- **Universal Binary Scale (UBS)**: Defined as $\mathcal{UBS}(X) = \log_2 (X / X_0) + S(X)$, with holographic entropy bounds.  
- **Foundational Axioms**: Six axioms covering duality, multiplication, geometry, dynamics, recursion, and code-theoretic discretization.  
- **Algorithmic Implementation**: Knowledge graph construction with NetworkX, entropy calculation, ternary search optimization, fractal enhancements. Includes Python script (`lcf_simulation.py`) for simulation. References include Wheeler (1990), Shannon (1948), Bekenstein (1973), and Maldacena (1999).

### Paper 3: Unified Holographic Resonance Theory: A Fusion of Arithmetic Proportionality and Entropic Dynamics
**Abstract:**  
This paper introduces the Unified Holographic Resonance Theory, a framework positing that reality emerges as a holographic system driven by two complementary forces. The system's generative and stabilizing engine is an **arithmetic proportionality** (from the Composite Dimensional Evolution Framework - MEDC), which defines the stable geometric structure of dimensions through the Simple and Compound Rules of Three. The system's dynamic and evolutionary impulse is a **layered entropic framework** (LCF), which describes the progression of complexity from a quantum duality through nine layers of emergence.  

We fuse these concepts, presenting a unified set of axioms where arithmetic laws (MEDC) provide the stable scaffolding for entropic processes (LCF). The primordial "Glitch" (MEDC) is formalized as the initial symmetry-breaking event and the engine for the "Meta-Recursive Cycle" (LCF). We propose a unified "Super Metric" that combines the Universal Binary Scale (UBS) with Inverse Proportional Density ($\rho \propto 1/L^n$), creating a testable, computable, and simulable model of a reality built on holographic, arithmetic resonance. Simulations validate the framework by demonstrating arithmetic glitches triggering entropic pruning, linking to prior works on, e.g., semantic opposition (validated on datasets like IMDB) in BUSS and triadic balancing in neurosymbolic AI.

**Key Methods/Approach:**  
- **Fusion of Frameworks**: Integrates MEDC (arithmetic rules) with LCF (entropic layers) via six fused axioms.  
- **Super Metric**: Combines UBS with inverse proportionality for quantification.  
- **Simulation Validation**: Python script (`uhrt_simulation_fase4.py`) builds graphs, computes stability ($\prod$ ratios / H), and simulates glitches/pruning. Includes glitch variant script.  
- **Applications**: Links to neurosymbolic AI and semantic modeling; testable on datasets like IMDB. References include Wheeler (1990), Maldacena (1999), and author's prior works.

## Usage
### Compiling Papers
To compile the LaTeX papers (requires a TeX distribution like TeX Live or MiKTeX):

```bash
cd papers/paper_1
pdflatex "Composite Dimensional Evolution Framework: A Foundational Theory based on Arithmetic Proportionality.tex"
# Repeat for paper_2 and paper_3
```

### Running Simulations
- **Paper 2 Simulation** (Layered Conceptual Framework graph and entropy optimization):
  ```bash
  python src/paper_2/lcf_simulation.py
  ```
  This generates a GEXF file in `results/paper_2/` for visualization (e.g., in Gephi).

- **Paper 3 Simulation** (UHRT stable scenario):
  ```bash
  python src/paper_3/uhrt_simulation_fase4.py
  ```
  Outputs logs and a PNG visualization in `results/paper_3/stable/`.

- **Paper 3 Glitch Scenario** (Simulates arithmetic glitch triggering entropic pruning):
  ```bash
  python src/paper_3/uhrt_simulation_fase4_glitch.py
  ```
  Outputs logs and a PNG in `results/paper_3/glitch/`.

These scripts demonstrate key UHRT concepts, such as graph construction, entropy bounds, and stability thresholds.

## Results
- **Paper 2**: Includes a sample knowledge graph (`knowledge_graph_9_layers.gexf`) representing the nine layers of LCF.
- **Paper 3**: Visualizations show stable vs. glitch scenarios, illustrating how imbalances in arithmetic proportionality lead to entropic adjustments.

Example outputs are stored in `results/`. For empirical testing or extensions, modify the scripts (e.g., adjust parameters in `uhrt_simulation_fase4.py` for custom glitch thresholds).
