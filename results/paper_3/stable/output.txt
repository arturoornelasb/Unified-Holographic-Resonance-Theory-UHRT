--- STARTING HOLOGRAPHIC RESONANCE THEORY SIMULATION (STABLE) ---

--- [PHASE 2: STRUCTURAL MAPPING (LCF + MEDC)] ---
Base LCF graph built with 18 nodes and 18 edges.

--- [PHASE 3: SUPER METRIC CALCULATION (INITIAL)] ---
Initial Entropy (LCF): 3.7398
Initial Super Metric UBS-UHM (MEDC+LCF): 6.2488

--- [PHASE 4: STABILITY SIMULATION (MEDC in LCF)] ---
Checking arithmetic stability of 'Stage 2 (LCF 4 / MEDC 2D)'...
Test values (MEDC): A=3, B=4, C=6
Result: STABLE. Simple Rule of Three resolved (X = 8).
System does not require entropic pruning.

--- [PHASE 5: VALIDATION (FINAL STATE)] ---
Final Entropy (LCF): 3.7398
Final Super Metric UBS-UHM (MEDC+LCF): 6.2488
