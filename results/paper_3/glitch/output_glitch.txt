--- STARTING HOLOGRAPHIC RESONANCE THEORY SIMULATION (GLITCH) ---

--- [PHASE 2: STRUCTURAL MAPPING (LCF + MEDC)] ---
Base LCF graph built with 18 nodes and 18 edges.

--- [PHASE 3: SUPER METRIC CALCULATION (INITIAL)] ---
Initial Entropy (LCF): 3.7398
Initial Super Metric UBS-UHM (MEDC+LCF): 6.2488

--- [PHASE 4: STABILITY SIMULATION (MEDC in LCF)] ---
Checking arithmetic stability of 'Stage 2 (LCF 4 / MEDC 2D)'...
Test values (MEDC): A=3, B=4, C=5
Result: UNSTABLE. Rule of Three did not resolve to an integer.
ARITHMETIC GLITCH DETECTED!!!
Triggering entropic pruning (LCF) to re-stabilize system...
Entropy before Glitch: 3.7398
Pruning complete. Pruning fraction: 0.4957
Entropy after Glitch: 3.0414

--- [PHASE 5: VALIDATION (FINAL STATE)] ---
Final Entropy (LCF): 3.0414
Final Super Metric UBS-UHM (MEDC+LCF): 5.5504
